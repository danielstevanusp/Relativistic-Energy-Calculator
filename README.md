this tool is a simple program designed to calculate energy based on einstein's famous equation from special relativity, e=mc^2. in this equation, e represents energy, m represents mass, and c is the speed of light. the tool takes user-inputted values for mass in kilograms and uses the constant speed of light to compute the corresponding energy.

how to use:

run python3 emc2.py

input values: users need to provide the mass (in kilograms) for which they want to calculate the energy. the input is obtained through a prompt.

speed of light: the speed of light is set as a constant in the program, with a value of 3.0 * 10^8 meters per second.

calculation: the tool employs the formula e=mc^2 to compute the energy by multiplying the mass with the square of the speed of light.

output: the calculated energy is then displayed, formatted in scientific notation, to provide a clear representation of the result.

example:

enter mass (kg): 5.0
the energy produced is 4.50e+17 joules.
this tool can be referred to as an relativistic energy calculator as it specifically focuses on the relationship between mass and energy as described by einstein's theory of special relativity.

disclaimer:
sorry if there are errors and calculations in the code, i'm still learning to improve it.
